# Binary-Beast
How did it start?
Since every project starts because we have faced a problem and we don't want that our fellow learners face the same one. This project starts with an identical motive. I used to stumble on a particular problem on Leetcode or any platform then I used to explore google. Wasted 2-3 hours and my mind buzzed but didn't come up with a fitting solution

You know what was the problem.? Since I was a newbie and I need a solution that has fewer predefined/complicated functions in code and more logic and mathematics behind the approach. But there a lack when it comes to Mathematics/logic. Everyone is running after predefined functions. So I thought I should develop a platform that deals with logic/mathematics rather than writing codes.  


What is Binary Beast?
Binary Beast is a website that consists the comprehensive details of complicated questions like coding questions from different-different coding platforms with sample test cases and dry run.

Idea:
If you are a beginner and witnessing a lot of problems in any particular topic and you have searched all the internet but you haven't encountered the appropriate solution which is basically beginner-friendly, then my mate this is the idea this website carries.

About Project:
How a new user use it?
Just visit toe the website BinaryBeasts and search your blog.
Explore the solution and try to do a dry run
If you have stuck, you can comment below the blog and let your colleagues arrange the solution.
If you have still some problems then let me know through Contact Us.
You can subscribe to us and we'll send you the best blogs through email weekly/monthly 

  Different sections in the project:  
Home:
Filter Section: You can filter by the first division so that traversing becomes easy for you. Filters are available for Website, Android, Java, etc.

Top 3 Articles on DSA: Since DSA is very important when it comes to coding. So here you can find the articles which have pure data structure based on the time of creation. The latest will be first.

Top 3 articles on Language: Here you will find the top 3 articles on particular programming languages like Java, Python, JavaScript, etc. It can be some language-specific concepts or maybe a coding question. For example Object type casting in Java. By this, you can make a strong grip over the language.

Top Recent Articles: Here you will find the latest articles without any filter criteria.

Top Articles on Web or Android: Here you can find the latest articles on full-stack web technologies or Android or ML anything.For example Activity life cycle of Android
All Blogs: I don't think I need further explanation.

About us: ..........................
Disqus API: I didn't design any comment logic from scratch and why should I do that if I can use Disqus API. Disqus API is a very powerful API for commenting or for discussion. So I just used it. There is no rocket science in this.
I also used CKEditor which is a Rich Text Field editor.

Used Tools and Technologies:
Backend: Django, Python
Front End: HTML5,CSS3,Bootstrap,JavaScript,CKEditor
Database: PostgreSQL, Django Database Administration
Third-Party APIs: Disqus API
Hosting: Pythonanywhere.com
Ide: PyCharm

  Future Scope and Improvements:
Add a more strong search engine and filter engine for a quick and wide response.
A compiler engine can be added to test the written solution. We can use a 3rd party tool or can build one from scratch.
Add a one-to-one chat system so that a user can ask doubts efficiently.
A subscription section can also be developed for prime members
Add a video solution


How much it succeeded?
